## Objective : 
Create an LED animation using x6 GPIOs from a ST development kit, this is a basic example to master 
STMCube IDE GPIO initialization and usage, the exercise includes use of ST HAL libraries 

## Platform : 
Board STM32 Nucleo - STM32F4 will be used.

## Functionality 
Six GPIOs will be used to generate a blink sequence with three different speeds :
* LOW_SPEED        -> 1Hz 
* MEDIUM_SPEED     -> 10Hz 
* HIGH_SPEED       -> 100Hz
